// Everything inside JS happens inside 'Execution Context'
/**

2 Components to this Execution context: 
    1. Memory(Variable env): where all variable, methods are stored as key-value pairs 
    2. Code(Thread of execution): where code is executed one line at a time

JS is a synchronous single thread language
    - it can move to next line only when current line completed executing
